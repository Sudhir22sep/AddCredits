## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
